# MLtimeseriesthesis

The thesis is based on developing a machine learning model to predict an oceanic buoy's meteorological variables and design an anomaly detection model to 
anticipate hurricanes and strong winds. The two years of research helped me gain in-depth knowledge of a wide range of machine learning methodologies like 
supervised and unsupervised techniques. Algorithms like Deep Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network are few among the significant learnings.  I have 
used different APIs like scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras on huge meteorological data for the development on an implementation front. Additional undertakings 
include integrating the machine learning model with a web application, thereby giving real-time weather predictions. For the same, an interactive web page was 
developed to simulate the patterns of the predictions in real-time. The substantial results in work have already initiated the deployment process of the whole 
system into production in the foreseeable future.
